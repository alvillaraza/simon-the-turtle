            After building HeadSpace in 2016, I decided to build a smaller, more
            portable vehicle to be able to transport it around to different
            events more easily. Working with an amazing team of friends from
            Phoenix, AZ, we built an electric, remote-controlled turtle: SIMON
            the TURTLE.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two years later, weâ€™ve refined the design so that it can completely
            disassemble into the bed of a pickup truck.
          </p>
          <p>
            SIMON the TURTLE is a Sensory Immersive Mobile Observation Nest the
            Transforming Universal Remote-controlled Load-bearing Electric
            vehicle.
